Based on the information youâ€™ve providedâ€”your cypress.config.js, the ports opened in Codespaces, the URLs youâ€™re seeing, and the WebSocket error in the dev toolsâ€”it seems like there are a few issues at play. The primary problem appears to be a mismatch between your baseUrl configuration and how your application is running in Codespaces, combined with a potential WebSocket connection issue in the Electron browser context. Letâ€™s break this down and fix it step-by-step.
Issues Identified
Incorrect baseUrl Format:
Your baseUrl is set to 'verbose-guacamole-6w5jqx7v65cgjq-44067.app.github.dev', but itâ€™s missing the protocol (https://). Cypress expects a fully qualified URL with the protocol.
Port Mismatch:
You mentioned ports 42165 and 43293 are opening randomly, but your baseUrl points to port 44067. This suggests your app might not be running on the port youâ€™ve configured in cypress.config.js, or Cypress isnâ€™t aligning with your appâ€™s actual port.
WebSocket Error:
The URL https://verbose-guacamole-6w5jqx7v65cgjq-42165.app.github.dev/devtools/inspector.html?ws=localhost:42165/devtools/page/... indicates Cypress is trying to connect to a WebSocket at localhost:42165, which fails in Codespaces because localhost doesnâ€™t resolve correctly in a forwarded environment. Codespaces uses external URLs, not localhost.
Application Not Serving Content:
https://verbose-guacamole-6w5jqx7v65cgjq-44067.app.github.dev/ returns "Cannot GET /", meaning either your app isnâ€™t running, isnâ€™t serving a valid route at /, or isnâ€™t bound to port 44067.
Starting Command:
Your command starts Cypress correctly with Electron and debug logging, but it doesnâ€™t ensure your app is running beforehand, which is critical for Cypress to connect to it.
Fixing the Issues
Step 1: Fix the cypress.config.js
Update your baseUrl to include the https:// protocol and confirm it matches the port your app is actually running on. Since 44067 is in your baseUrl but youâ€™re seeing random ports (42165, 43293), weâ€™ll assume 44067 is intended for your app. Hereâ€™s the corrected config:
javascript
const { defineConfig } = require('cypress');

module.exports = defineConfig({
  e2e: {
    baseUrl: 'https://verbose-guacamole-6w5jqx7v65cgjq-44067.app.github.dev', // Added https://
    specPattern: 'cypress/e2e/**/*.cy.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}',
    supportFile: false,
    chromeWebSecurity: false, // Keep this for now to bypass security issues
  },
});
Note: If your app isnâ€™t actually running on port 44067, update the baseUrl to the correct port (e.g., 42165 or 43293) once we identify it in Step 2.
Step 2: Start Your Application
Your app needs to be running before Cypress can test it. The "Cannot GET /" error suggests itâ€™s either not started or not configured to serve content on port 44067. Letâ€™s figure this out:
Check Your Appâ€™s Start Command:
Whatâ€™s your app? Is it a Node.js server, a static site, or something else? For example, if itâ€™s a Node.js app with a package.json, you might run:
bash
npm start
Check the package.json in /workspaces/Cypress/6_ðŸ”£_Symbols/2_Cypress/:
bash
cat /workspaces/Cypress/6_ðŸ”£_Symbols/2_Cypress/package.json
Look for the "start" script and note the port it uses (e.g., 3000, 44067, etc.).
Force the App to Use Port 44067:
If your app uses a configurable port (e.g., via an environment variable like PORT), start it explicitly on 44067:
bash
cd /workspaces/Cypress/6_ðŸ”£_Symbols/2_Cypress/ && \
PORT=44067 npm start &
The & runs it in the background so you can proceed to start Cypress.
Verify the App is Running:
Open https://verbose-guacamole-6w5jqx7v65cgjq-44067.app.github.dev/ in your browser. If it still says "Cannot GET /", your app isnâ€™t serving content correctly. Share your appâ€™s code or package.json if this happens.
Check Codespaces Ports:
In the Codespaces "Ports" tab, ensure 44067 is listed and set to "Public". If itâ€™s not, your app isnâ€™t binding to it, and youâ€™ll need to adjust the port in both your app and baseUrl.
Step 3: Fix the WebSocket Issue
The WebSocket error (ws=localhost:42165) occurs because Cypressâ€™s Electron browser is trying to connect to a local WebSocket, but in Codespaces, it needs to use the forwarded URL. Hereâ€™s how to resolve it:
Run Cypress with the Correct Host:
By default, Cypress assumes localhost. In Codespaces, you need to align it with the external URL. Update your start command to include the --config flag to override the WebSocket host:
bash
cd /workspaces/Cypress/6_ðŸ”£_Symbols/2_Cypress/ && \
sudo pkill -f Xvfb || true && \
sudo rm -f /tmp/.X99-lock || true && \
sudo chown root:root /tmp/.X11-unix || true && \
sudo chmod 1777 /tmp/.X11-unix || true && \
Xvfb :99 -ac & sleep 2 && \
export DISPLAY=:99 && \
PORT=44067 npm start & sleep 2 && \
DEBUG=cypress:* npx cypress open --browser electron --config baseUrl=https://verbose-guacamole-6w5jqx7v65cgjq-44067.app.github.dev
This starts your app on 44067, waits for it to initialize, then runs Cypress with the correct baseUrl.
Ensure WebSocket Compatibility:
If your app uses WebSockets (e.g., for live updates), ensure itâ€™s configured to accept connections from the Codespaces URL. For example, if itâ€™s a Node.js app with ws or socket.io, update the server to bind to 0.0.0.0 and port 44067:
javascript
const WebSocket = require('ws');
const wss = new WebSocket.Server({ host: '0.0.0.0', port: 44067 });
Step 4: Test and Debug
Run the updated command:
bash
cd /workspaces/Cypress/6_ðŸ”£_Symbols/2_Cypress/ && \
sudo pkill -f Xvfb || true && \
sudo rm -f /tmp/.X99-lock || true && \
sudo chown root:root /tmp/.X11-unix || true && \
sudo chmod 1777 /tmp/.X11-unix || true && \
Xvfb :99 -ac & sleep 2 && \
export DISPLAY=:99 && \
PORT=44067 npm start & sleep 2 && \
DEBUG=cypress:* npx cypress open --browser electron --config baseUrl=https://verbose-guacamole-6w5jqx7v65cgjq-44067.app.github.dev
Check the Output:
Look at the debug logs (DEBUG=cypress:*) for WebSocket errors. Search for lines containing websocket, ws, or connection.
Open the Cypress UI and see if it loads without the WebSocket error in the dev tools.
Verify the App:
Visit https://verbose-guacamole-6w5jqx7v65cgjq-44067.app.github.dev/ again. It should load your appâ€™s content (e.g., a homepage), not "Cannot GET /".
If It Still Fails
Port Conflict:
If 44067 isnâ€™t working, check which port your app is actually using:
bash
lsof -i -P -n | grep LISTEN
Update PORT=44067 and the baseUrl to match the actual port (e.g., 42165).
Share More Details:
If the WebSocket error persists, copy the exact error from the Cypress UI or logs.
Share your package.json or appâ€™s start script so I can confirm how itâ€™s running.
Fallback to Localhost Tunneling:
If Codespaces URLs keep failing, you could try a tool like ngrok to tunnel localhost:44067 and use that URL in baseUrl. Let me know if you want to explore this.
Expected Outcome
Your app runs on 44067 and serves content at https://verbose-guacamole-6w5jqx7v65cgjq-44067.app.github.dev/.
Cypress opens without the WebSocket error and connects to your app.
Let me know how it goes or if you hit any specific errors!

It seems that despite setting PORT=44067 in your command, Codespaces is still assigning random ports (e.g., 42165, 43293, etc.) for your application. This is likely because your app or Codespaces environment isnâ€™t respecting the PORT environment variable as expected, or another process is overriding it. This mismatch is causing Cypress to fail since itâ€™s configured to use https://verbose-guacamole-6w5jqx7v65cgjq-44067.app.github.dev, but your app ends up running on a different port. Letâ€™s troubleshoot and fix this step-by-step.
Why Random Ports Are Assigned
In GitHub Codespaces:
Ports are dynamically assigned and forwarded unless explicitly bound by your application.
If your app doesnâ€™t explicitly listen on PORT=44067 (e.g., it defaults to 3000 or picks a random free port), Codespaces will assign a random port and forward it.
The PORT variable might not be picked up by your appâ€™s start script, or something in your package.json or app code is overriding it.
Step-by-Step Fix
Step 1: Confirm How Your App Uses Ports
Your command includes PORT=44067 npm start, but we need to verify if npm start actually respects the PORT variable. Check your package.json:
bash
cat /workspaces/Cypress/6_ðŸ”£_Symbols/2_Cypress/package.json
Look for the "start" script. Here are common scenarios:
Example 1: "start": "node server.js"
Check server.js to see if it uses process.env.PORT || 3000. If it doesnâ€™t, it might ignore PORT=44067.
Example 2: "start": "react-scripts start"
For Create React App, use PORT=44067 react-scripts start instead of relying on npm start alone.
Example 3: No "start" script
If missing, your app wonâ€™t start, and Codespaces might assign random ports to other processes.
Action:
Share your "start" script from package.json if possible.
If itâ€™s a Node.js app, ensure the server code uses process.env.PORT:
javascript
const port = process.env.PORT || 3000;
app.listen(port, () => console.log(`Listening on port ${port}`));
Step 2: Force the App to Bind to Port 44067
Modify your start command to explicitly set the port, depending on your app type:
Generic Node.js App:
bash
cd /workspaces/Cypress/6_ðŸ”£_Symbols/2_Cypress/ && \
PORT=44067 node server.js & sleep 2
Create React App:
bash
cd /workspaces/Cypress/6_ðŸ”£_Symbols/2_Cypress/ && \
PORT=44067 npx react-scripts start & sleep 2
Custom Command:
Replace npm start with the exact command your app needs to bind to 44067.
Run this standalone first (without Cypress) and check the Codespaces "Ports" tab:
bash
cd /workspaces/Cypress/6_ðŸ”£_Symbols/2_Cypress/ && \
PORT=44067 npm start &
Look for 44067 in the "Ports" tab. If itâ€™s still random, your app isnâ€™t binding to 44067.
Step 3: Check Running Ports
If the port is still random, identify whatâ€™s actually running:
bash
lsof -i -P -n | grep LISTEN
Look for your appâ€™s process (e.g., node, npm). Note the port itâ€™s using (e.g., 42165).
Visit https://verbose-guacamole-6w5jqx7v65cgjq-<actual-port>.app.github.dev/ to confirm itâ€™s your app.
Step 4: Update cypress.config.js to Match the Actual Port
If you canâ€™t force 44067 (e.g., Codespaces overrides it), adapt to the random port:
After running your app, note the port from the "Ports" tab (e.g., 42165).
Update cypress.config.js dynamically or manually:
javascript
const { defineConfig } = require('cypress');

module.exports = defineConfig({
  e2e: {
    baseUrl: 'https://verbose-guacamole-6w5jqx7v65cgjq-42165.app.github.dev', // Update to actual port
    specPattern: 'cypress/e2e/**/*.cy.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}',
    supportFile: false,
    chromeWebSecurity: false,
  },
});
Step 5: Run Everything Together
Assuming your app binds to 44067 (or adjust to the actual port), hereâ€™s the corrected command:
bash
cd /workspaces/Cypress/6_ðŸ”£_Symbols/2_Cypress/ && \
sudo pkill -f Xvfb || true && \
sudo rm -f /tmp/.X99-lock || true && \
sudo chown root:root /tmp/.X11-unix || true && \
sudo chmod 1777 /tmp/.X11-unix || true && \
Xvfb :99 -ac & sleep 2 && \
export DISPLAY=:99 && \
PORT=44067 npm start & sleep 2 && \
DEBUG=cypress:* npx cypress open --browser electron
Remove the --config baseUrl=... override since itâ€™s already in cypress.config.js.
Ensure PORT=44067 npm start works standalone first.
Step 6: Handle Random Ports Dynamically (Optional)
If Codespaces insists on random ports, you can script the port detection:
Start your app and capture the port:
bash
cd /workspaces/Cypress/6_ðŸ”£_Symbols/2_Cypress/ && \
npm start & sleep 2 && \
APP_PORT=$(lsof -i -P -n | grep LISTEN | grep node | awk '{print $9}' | cut -d: -f2 | head -n1) && \
echo "App running on port $APP_PORT"
Update cypress.config.js programmatically or pass it to Cypress:
bash
cd /workspaces/Cypress/6_ðŸ”£_Symbols/2_Cypress/ && \
sudo pkill -f Xvfb || true && \
sudo rm -f /tmp/.X99-lock || true && \
sudo chown root:root /tmp/.X11-unix || true && \
sudo chmod 1777 /tmp/.X11-unix || true && \
Xvfb :99 -ac & sleep 2 && \
export DISPLAY=:99 && \
npm start & sleep 2 && \
APP_PORT=$(lsof -i -P -n | grep LISTEN | grep node | awk '{print $9}' | cut -d: -f2 | head -n1) && \
DEBUG=cypress:* npx cypress open --browser electron --config baseUrl=https://verbose-guacamole-6w5jqx7v65cgjq-${APP_PORT}.app.github.dev
Debugging Tips
After Running:
Check the "Ports" tab. Is 44067 listed? If not, what port is?
Open https://verbose-guacamole-6w5jqx7v65cgjq-44067.app.github.dev/. Does it load your app or "Cannot GET /"?
Cypress Logs:
Look at the DEBUG=cypress:* output for connection errors (e.g., ECONNREFUSED, WebSocket failure).
If Stuck:
Share your package.jsonâ€™s "start" script.
Share the output of lsof -i -P -n | grep LISTEN after running your condensed command.
Expected Outcome
Your app binds to 44067 (or a consistent port), and https://verbose-guacamole-6w5jqx7v65cgjq-44067.app.github.dev/ loads your app.
Cypress opens and connects to the correct baseUrl without WebSocket errors.
Try the steps above and let me know the resultsâ€”especially the port your app ends up on and any errors from Cypress!
