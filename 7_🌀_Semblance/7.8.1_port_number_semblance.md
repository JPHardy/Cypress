Based on the information youâ€™ve providedâ€”your cypress.config.js, the ports opened in Codespaces, the URLs youâ€™re seeing, and the WebSocket error in the dev toolsâ€”it seems like there are a few issues at play. The primary problem appears to be a mismatch between your baseUrl configuration and how your application is running in Codespaces, combined with a potential WebSocket connection issue in the Electron browser context. Letâ€™s break this down and fix it step-by-step.
Issues Identified
Incorrect baseUrl Format:
Your baseUrl is set to 'verbose-guacamole-6w5jqx7v65cgjq-44067.app.github.dev', but itâ€™s missing the protocol (https://). Cypress expects a fully qualified URL with the protocol.
Port Mismatch:
You mentioned ports 42165 and 43293 are opening randomly, but your baseUrl points to port 44067. This suggests your app might not be running on the port youâ€™ve configured in cypress.config.js, or Cypress isnâ€™t aligning with your appâ€™s actual port.
WebSocket Error:
The URL https://verbose-guacamole-6w5jqx7v65cgjq-42165.app.github.dev/devtools/inspector.html?ws=localhost:42165/devtools/page/... indicates Cypress is trying to connect to a WebSocket at localhost:42165, which fails in Codespaces because localhost doesnâ€™t resolve correctly in a forwarded environment. Codespaces uses external URLs, not localhost.
Application Not Serving Content:
https://verbose-guacamole-6w5jqx7v65cgjq-44067.app.github.dev/ returns "Cannot GET /", meaning either your app isnâ€™t running, isnâ€™t serving a valid route at /, or isnâ€™t bound to port 44067.
Starting Command:
Your command starts Cypress correctly with Electron and debug logging, but it doesnâ€™t ensure your app is running beforehand, which is critical for Cypress to connect to it.
Fixing the Issues
Step 1: Fix the cypress.config.js
Update your baseUrl to include the https:// protocol and confirm it matches the port your app is actually running on. Since 44067 is in your baseUrl but youâ€™re seeing random ports (42165, 43293), weâ€™ll assume 44067 is intended for your app. Hereâ€™s the corrected config:
javascript
const { defineConfig } = require('cypress');

module.exports = defineConfig({
  e2e: {
    baseUrl: 'https://verbose-guacamole-6w5jqx7v65cgjq-44067.app.github.dev', // Added https://
    specPattern: 'cypress/e2e/**/*.cy.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}',
    supportFile: false,
    chromeWebSecurity: false, // Keep this for now to bypass security issues
  },
});
Note: If your app isnâ€™t actually running on port 44067, update the baseUrl to the correct port (e.g., 42165 or 43293) once we identify it in Step 2.
Step 2: Start Your Application
Your app needs to be running before Cypress can test it. The "Cannot GET /" error suggests itâ€™s either not started or not configured to serve content on port 44067. Letâ€™s figure this out:
Check Your Appâ€™s Start Command:
Whatâ€™s your app? Is it a Node.js server, a static site, or something else? For example, if itâ€™s a Node.js app with a package.json, you might run:
bash
npm start
Check the package.json in /workspaces/Cypress/6_ðŸ”£_Symbols/2_Cypress/:
bash
cat /workspaces/Cypress/6_ðŸ”£_Symbols/2_Cypress/package.json
Look for the "start" script and note the port it uses (e.g., 3000, 44067, etc.).
Force the App to Use Port 44067:
If your app uses a configurable port (e.g., via an environment variable like PORT), start it explicitly on 44067:
bash
cd /workspaces/Cypress/6_ðŸ”£_Symbols/2_Cypress/ && \
PORT=44067 npm start &
The & runs it in the background so you can proceed to start Cypress.
Verify the App is Running:
Open https://verbose-guacamole-6w5jqx7v65cgjq-44067.app.github.dev/ in your browser. If it still says "Cannot GET /", your app isnâ€™t serving content correctly. Share your appâ€™s code or package.json if this happens.
Check Codespaces Ports:
In the Codespaces "Ports" tab, ensure 44067 is listed and set to "Public". If itâ€™s not, your app isnâ€™t binding to it, and youâ€™ll need to adjust the port in both your app and baseUrl.
Step 3: Fix the WebSocket Issue
The WebSocket error (ws=localhost:42165) occurs because Cypressâ€™s Electron browser is trying to connect to a local WebSocket, but in Codespaces, it needs to use the forwarded URL. Hereâ€™s how to resolve it:
Run Cypress with the Correct Host:
By default, Cypress assumes localhost. In Codespaces, you need to align it with the external URL. Update your start command to include the --config flag to override the WebSocket host:
bash
cd /workspaces/Cypress/6_ðŸ”£_Symbols/2_Cypress/ && \
sudo pkill -f Xvfb || true && \
sudo rm -f /tmp/.X99-lock || true && \
sudo chown root:root /tmp/.X11-unix || true && \
sudo chmod 1777 /tmp/.X11-unix || true && \
Xvfb :99 -ac & sleep 2 && \
export DISPLAY=:99 && \
PORT=44067 npm start & sleep 2 && \
DEBUG=cypress:* npx cypress open --browser electron --config baseUrl=https://verbose-guacamole-6w5jqx7v65cgjq-44067.app.github.dev
This starts your app on 44067, waits for it to initialize, then runs Cypress with the correct baseUrl.
Ensure WebSocket Compatibility:
If your app uses WebSockets (e.g., for live updates), ensure itâ€™s configured to accept connections from the Codespaces URL. For example, if itâ€™s a Node.js app with ws or socket.io, update the server to bind to 0.0.0.0 and port 44067:
javascript
const WebSocket = require('ws');
const wss = new WebSocket.Server({ host: '0.0.0.0', port: 44067 });
Step 4: Test and Debug
Run the updated command:
bash
cd /workspaces/Cypress/6_ðŸ”£_Symbols/2_Cypress/ && \
sudo pkill -f Xvfb || true && \
sudo rm -f /tmp/.X99-lock || true && \
sudo chown root:root /tmp/.X11-unix || true && \
sudo chmod 1777 /tmp/.X11-unix || true && \
Xvfb :99 -ac & sleep 2 && \
export DISPLAY=:99 && \
PORT=44067 npm start & sleep 2 && \
DEBUG=cypress:* npx cypress open --browser electron --config baseUrl=https://verbose-guacamole-6w5jqx7v65cgjq-44067.app.github.dev
Check the Output:
Look at the debug logs (DEBUG=cypress:*) for WebSocket errors. Search for lines containing websocket, ws, or connection.
Open the Cypress UI and see if it loads without the WebSocket error in the dev tools.
Verify the App:
Visit https://verbose-guacamole-6w5jqx7v65cgjq-44067.app.github.dev/ again. It should load your appâ€™s content (e.g., a homepage), not "Cannot GET /".
If It Still Fails
Port Conflict:
If 44067 isnâ€™t working, check which port your app is actually using:
bash
lsof -i -P -n | grep LISTEN
Update PORT=44067 and the baseUrl to match the actual port (e.g., 42165).
Share More Details:
If the WebSocket error persists, copy the exact error from the Cypress UI or logs.
Share your package.json or appâ€™s start script so I can confirm how itâ€™s running.
Fallback to Localhost Tunneling:
If Codespaces URLs keep failing, you could try a tool like ngrok to tunnel localhost:44067 and use that URL in baseUrl. Let me know if you want to explore this.
Expected Outcome
Your app runs on 44067 and serves content at https://verbose-guacamole-6w5jqx7v65cgjq-44067.app.github.dev/.
Cypress opens without the WebSocket error and connects to your app.
Let me know how it goes or if you hit any specific errors!
