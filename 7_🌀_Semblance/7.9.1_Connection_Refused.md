/fix
Your pod is stuck in **Pending** status, likely due to resource constraints or issues with pulling the Cypress image. Here‚Äôs how to debug and fix it:

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Check Pod Status**
Run this to see why the pod is not starting:
```sh
kubectl get pods
```
If it shows **Pending**, check the events with:
```sh
kubectl describe pod <POD_NAME>
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Delete and Recreate the Deployment**
Since your deployment already exists but isn't working, delete and recreate it:
```sh
kubectl delete deployment cypress-test
kubectl create deployment cypress-test --image=cypress/included:12.17.2
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Check Minikube Resources**
If the pod is still stuck, check if Minikube has enough resources:
```sh
kubectl get nodes
kubectl describe node minikube
```
If it's out of memory or CPU, restart it with more resources:
```sh
minikube delete
minikube start --memory=4096 --cpus=2 --driver=docker
```

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ **Force Image Pull**
Sometimes the image isn't downloaded properly. Try forcing a pull:
```sh
kubectl set image deployment/cypress-test cypress-test=cypress/included:12.17.2 --record
```

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ **Verify Pod Logs**
If the pod is still crashing, check its logs:
```sh
kubectl logs deployment/cypress-test
```

Try these steps and let me know what errors you see! üöÄ
