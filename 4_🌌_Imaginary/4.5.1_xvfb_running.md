I see there's already an Xvfb process running on display :99. The good news is you don't need to start a new one. You can simply use the existing display by setting the DISPLAY environment variable:

```bash
export DISPLAY=:99
```

Then try running Cypress:

```bash
npx cypress open
```

Since Xvfb is already running, you just need to tell your Cypress session which display to use. The error you received was because you tried to start a second Xvfb process on the same display number that was already in use.

If you still encounter issues, you could kill the existing Xvfb process and start fresh:

```bash
# Kill the existing Xvfb process
kill 36495

# Wait a moment
sleep 1

# Remove lock file if it exists
sudo rm -f /tmp/.X99-lock

# Start a new Xvfb session
Xvfb :99 &

# Set display
export DISPLAY=:99

# Run Cypress
npx cypress open
```

But it's simpler to just use the already running Xvfb process if it's working properly.

---

Here's the entire sequence as a one-liner:

```bash
kill 36495 && sleep 1 && sudo rm -f /tmp/.X99-lock && Xvfb :99 & && export DISPLAY=:99 && npx cypress open
kill 36495 && sleep 1 && sudo rm -f /tmp/.X99-lock && Xvfb :99 & sleep 1 && export DISPLAY=:99 && npx cypress open
```

It looks like there's a syntax issue with your command. The problem is likely caused by the `&` immediately before `&& export DISPLAY=:99`. The `&` is used to run a command in the background, but then `&&` expects a successful command before continuing.

Try this instead:

```bash
kill 36495 && sleep 1 && sudo rm -f /tmp/.X99-lock && Xvfb :99 & sleep 1 && export DISPLAY=:99 && npx cypress open
```

This ensures `Xvfb :99` runs in the background (`&`), and then we add a `sleep 1` to allow it to start before setting `DISPLAY`.

Let me know if you need further troubleshooting! ðŸš€
