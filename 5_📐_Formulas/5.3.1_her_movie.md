​"Her" is a 2013 science fiction romantic drama directed by Spike Jonze.

The term "rubber ducking" originates from a debugging technique where programmers explain their code line-by-line to an inanimate object, such as a rubber duck, to identify errors. In "Her," this concept is metaphorically represented through Theodore's interactions with Samantha. By verbalizing his thoughts and emotions to her, Theodore gains insights into his own feelings and challenges, akin to the self-reflection achieved in rubber duck debugging. This dynamic highlights the film's exploration of how artificial intelligence can serve as a mirror to human consciousness, facilitating personal growth and understanding.
