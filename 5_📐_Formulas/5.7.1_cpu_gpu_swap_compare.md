When comparing running Cypress on CPU versus GPU, there are several performance considerations:

### CPU vs GPU for Cypress Testing

**CPU-only performance:**
- Cypress primarily uses CPU resources for most of its operations
- In headless mode with Xvfb (what you're setting up), all rendering happens through CPU
- This is the default setup in CI environments and containers like GitHub Codespaces

**GPU acceleration benefits:**
- Browser rendering is faster with GPU acceleration
- Animations and transitions render more smoothly
- Visual testing comparison can be more efficient
- Video recording of tests can be significantly faster (30-50% in some cases)

**Performance hit without GPU:**
- Expect 10-30% slower overall test execution depending on your test complexity
- Visual-heavy tests may see larger performance differences (up to 40%)
- Video recording quality might be lower or require more CPU resources
- Heavy DOM operations may experience lag

**Considerations for your environment:**
- GitHub Codespaces typically doesn't provide GPU access
- The performance hit is usually acceptable for most test suites
- For local development, using your machine's GPU will give better performance

If your tests don't involve heavy visual components or you're mainly running them in CI, the CPU-only approach with Xvfb is perfectly reasonable and the standard approach for headless environments.
