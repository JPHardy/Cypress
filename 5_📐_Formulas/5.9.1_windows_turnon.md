hey everyone welcome back in the Cypress
0:02
tutorial let's quickly get into the real
0:06
Hands-On and see what are the
0:08
prerequisites to get up and running with
0:10
our first test case with Cyprus okay now
0:15
before you deep dive into any of the
0:17
tool the first and foremost thing is to
0:20
understand what all system requirement
0:23
the software requirement you need to
0:25
have in your machine okay so as we are
0:27
learning so we'll be focusing on our
0:29
laptops or desktop whatever you have so
0:32
we have to check what is the system
0:33
requirement for installing Cyprus okay
0:36
then the once we know that our system
0:39
matches the software the hardware
0:41
everything is which obviously will you
0:44
you guys would I'm assuming that you
0:46
won't be using such an old system that
0:47
you won't be having those requirement or
0:49
your system won't be meeting those
0:50
requirements with Cyprus need but just
0:52
in case you know we need to basically go
0:54
ahead and cross check that our system
0:56
matches those requirements so we don't
0:58
just end up in endless loop on of
1:00
debugging some of the errors okay now
1:02
the next thing is in order to start
1:05
using Cyprus the most important thing as
1:08
we have understood about in the
1:09
architecture as well you need a node.js
1:12
right so node.js is a third runtime
1:15
environment for JavaScript code okay so
1:17
it's kind of a JRE as you you can
1:19
correlate it as a JRE for Java for
1:22
JavaScript it's node that runs your
1:25
JavaScript code so we have to install
1:27
that the second step and then whatever
1:29
preferable ID integrated development
1:31
environment the ID that we want to use
1:33
you want to use Eclipse you want to use
1:35
jetbrains Aqua is another one which is
1:37
basically only for the QA and then
1:39
Visual Studio code so in this tutorial
1:42
series I'll be going ahead with the
1:43
visual studio code open it is basically
1:46
free to use and very very powerful IDE
1:49
so we'll be going ahead with the visual
1:51
studio code but you are free to use any
1:53
of the others if you are comfortable
1:55
using other Ides as well okay so that's
1:59
the third step once we are done with
2:02
this setup this is basically the system
2:04
setup is complete right and one system
2:07
setup is complete the next step is to do
2:09
or create the first project of Cyprus
2:12
install Cyprus and then go ahead and
2:16
write our first test case right so this
2:18
is the I'll make it as step one okay
2:21
this is step one a wherein will install
2:23
all of these dependencies that we need
2:26
in order to install Cyprus and in the
2:28
Step 2 we'll go ahead with the Cypress
2:30
installation process so Cypress
2:32
installation process is the next step
2:36
which will cover once we are done with
2:38
this okay so let's go and see the system
2:40
requirements right so now we are on the
2:42
Cyprus website okay if you simply go to
2:44
the documentation right don't official
2:46
documentation is the best documentation
2:47
to refer you can go to the other
2:50
documentation only if you need a bit
2:52
more detail or something different which
2:54
is not available on the official
2:55
documentation but Cyprus documentation
2:57
is very comprehensive so we'll simply go
2:59
ahead the dogs and you'll see that we
3:01
can simply see here a link installing
3:04
Cypress okay so click on the installing
3:06
Cyprus and this will basically lead you
3:09
to this installing Cypress page and
3:12
let's see prior to installing Cyprus
3:14
what are the predicts okay so system
3:16
requirement right so prerequisite step
3:18
one what operating system right so Mac
3:20
OS this version above right if you're on
3:22
Linux you have to make sure you are
3:24
having all these things if you're on
3:26
Windows make sure you are seven and
3:28
above 64-bit only right so this is why
3:31
we need to look into it so for say for
3:33
example you don't have Windows 7 and
3:34
above which higher is highly unlikely
3:36
but then in case you don't have right
3:38
then you Cyprus won't be working
3:40
properly on your machine or it won't be
3:42
even setting up right then the next
3:44
thing is you need node.js okay if you're
3:46
using you know npm a pnpm or yam to
3:49
install Cyprus which we'll be using will
3:51
be using node package manager node npm
3:54
stands for node package manager and pnpm
3:56
and Yan are another they are also a
3:59
packet manager bit more sort of there
4:01
were limitations in the node packet
4:03
manager that that are being resolved
4:05
with pnpm and yam okay so if you want to
4:08
correlate npm you can correlate it with
4:11
the PIP in Python right which is uh
4:13
which we used to install any of the
4:15
Python packages so for node.js we use
4:18
npm which is node packet manager to
4:19
install any of the packages so we need
4:21
to have these supported versions so we
4:24
have to make sure that we have node
4:26
installed in our machine okay and then
4:28
obviously the hardware if you are
4:30
running you have to make sure that your
4:32
you comply or the hardware and memory
4:34
requirements are met as well right so
4:36
4GB is minimum 8GB Plus or longer test
4:39
runs right so this is something which is
4:42
the step one okay the second step is
4:44
installing node.js right now let's
4:46
quickly go ahead and install node.js so
4:48
what we'll do is we'll say okay node.js
4:51
download okay simply search for node.js
4:54
download and it will lead you to the
4:57
node.js website where in node.js.org and
5:00
we will simply go ahead to the download
5:02
page and here you will see that we have
5:04
the windows installer and installing
5:06
node.js is absolutely simple so let's
5:08
quickly go ahead and depending on which
5:11
machine you are on which platform you
5:13
are on for example you are on Mac OS you
5:15
have to download Mac if you're on other
5:17
platforms then you have to download
5:19
accordingly right for example if you are
5:21
on Linux then you have to download the
5:24
Linux binaries okay I'm on windows so
5:26
I'll simply go ahead and download the
5:28
windows installer simply click on it and
5:30
you'll see the windows at the node
5:32
version 18 is downloading okay and if
5:35
you go back to the Cypress here you'll
5:37
see that
5:38
node.js18x 16x and 20x and above are all
5:42
supported so I'm good with that we are
5:45
downloading 18 version 18 and above
5:47
right so which is absolutely fine so now
5:49
download is finished if I go to the
5:52
download and we simply go ahead and if I
5:55
open the folder where it got downloaded
5:57
so it's here and I can simply go ahead
6:00
and double click to install node on my
6:02
machine you'll see node.js setup has
6:04
started right I'll simply go ahead and
6:06
click next read the agreements all right
6:08
and then accept click on next and you'll
6:11
see that it will install more JS to a
6:13
specific location which is C program
6:15
files node.js if you're not happy with
6:17
this default location you can change
6:19
this location anytime okay so you can
6:22
click on this change and then change
6:23
this location I'm happy with this
6:25
particular location I'll simply go ahead
6:27
and next and then you will see that
6:28
click the icons in the tree below to
6:30
change the way features will be
6:32
installed right if you want to change
6:33
anything here you can click and change
6:36
it I'll keep it as default okay and then
6:39
you'll see that we have this notepad npm
6:42
package manager will also be installed
6:44
right which because which will be using
6:46
to install any of the packages or even
6:48
Cyprus right so you can basically see
6:51
that if I click on this you will see
6:53
that entire feature will be unavailable
6:55
if I deselect this right so that is why
6:57
whatever is default all just keep it as
6:59
is so that we get the npm package
7:02
manager installed as well so it has the
7:04
node.js runtime core pack npm right and
7:07
then adding to path as well so this
7:08
node.js will be added to path as well
7:10
okay so you can simply keep it default
7:13
and click next and then here it says
7:15
that you can optionally install the
7:16
tools necessary to compile native
7:18
modules I'll just keep it as is I don't
7:21
want any other necessary tools I just
7:24
want node.js so I'll keep it default
7:25
which is unchecked I'll simply click on
7:27
next and click on install okay so now it
7:30
will install node.js it has popped up
7:32
that I want to install allow this device
7:34
allow this app yes absolutely and then
7:37
it will validate and install nodes okay
7:39
so you'll see that it has completed the
7:41
node.js setup is odd it has finished it
7:43
has successfully installed node.js okay
7:46
I'll simply click on finish and now how
7:48
we can check that node.js is installed
7:50
okay so we'll simply go on the command
7:52
prompt okay I'll open the command prompt
7:54
and I'll say node hyphen V and you'll
7:57
see the version is available so
7:59
whichever version has been installed is
8:01
available now because I have selected
8:03
the path wherever the node was installed
8:05
okay so that path has been added into
8:08
the environment variables automatically
8:10
now if you are on Linux or Mac OS you
8:13
can simply Google how to add the path by
8:15
default in the installation wizard you
8:18
will get that option how to add path but
8:20
in case you are not able to see the load
8:23
version the terminal and installation is
8:25
successful you can add the location of
8:28
the binaries in the environment variable
8:30
and then you will be able to see the
8:33
node version that it has been installed
8:35
now on Windows say for example you want
8:38
to set up the path manually right now
8:41
here if we go back and say to the we
8:44
know that node has been installed into
8:46
the program files right so it was
8:48
program files and then was node.js right
8:51
so here we have this node.exe now in
8:54
case this particular location is not a
8:57
available in the environment variable
9:00
then if we go to the command prompt okay
9:02
and if say for example I am at the C
9:05
drive okay and I say node hyphen V you
9:08
will see I it doesn't matter which
9:09
location I am still it is recognized and
9:11
the reason being that it is basically
9:12
identified through the environment
9:15
variable the global environment variable
9:17
so how you can set up the environment
9:19
variable in case it is not set up
9:21
automatically right this is only
9:22
optional case in case it is not working
9:25
in your case so you simply have to go to
9:26
the PC right click okay go to the
9:29
properties on Windows okay right click
9:31
on the PC go to properties and then you
9:33
will see Advanced system settings and
9:35
here you will see environment variables
9:37
and if you see that this is the these
9:40
are the user variables okay and then
9:42
there are there is a system variable you
9:43
will see the path variable okay so if
9:46
you simply click on edit you will see by
9:49
default C program files node.js location
9:52
is added here okay and this has been
9:54
added during the installation itself now
9:56
in case if this is not press present
9:58
here when you try to run node commands
10:01
you will see that it is not recognized
10:04
okay in case you find that it is not
10:07
recognizing the node command after
10:08
installation you have to Simply check
10:10
the environment variable click on the
10:12
new and put the location of the node.js
10:15
installation wherever it has been
10:17
installed okay wherever you have changed
10:18
the location on if you have installed
10:20
the default location put that location
10:22
here okay and then simply click on OK OK
10:26
and then that should be it okay so this
10:28
is this is one thing now here for the
10:31
user variables as well you will see that
10:33
there is a path variable so you can also
10:35
do the same thing in the user variable
10:37
if you always have a specific user
10:39
variable but if you do it in the system
10:41
variable by default it will be
10:43
recognized for all the systems or all
10:45
the users on the system okay so this is
10:48
how you are going to do this on your
10:50
Windows machine in case the path is not
10:53
added for the node installation so this
10:55
is the second step that you have done we
10:56
have installed node.js right now the
10:59
third thing is we have to install our
11:01
preferred IDE so we'll go ahead and
11:04
install Visual Studio code because we'll
11:06
be using visual studio code to write our
11:08
test cases in Cyprus so I'll simply go
11:10
to the Google okay and I'll say Visual
11:13
Studio code okay so you'll see it has
11:16
popped up and you will see that we have
11:19
the download option directly here so
11:21
I'll click on this you simply go to
11:23
code.visualstudio.com or search for
11:25
visual studio code you will easily get
11:27
it right it's not any rocket science
11:29
you'll see that I'm on the download page
11:31
okay and then download visual studio
11:33
code which is basically in my case I'm
11:36
on windows so I'll download for Windows
11:37
if you are on Linux or Mac you download
11:40
accordingly okay I'll simply click on
11:42
Windows and you'll see that it will
11:44
automatically start a download so I'll
11:46
simply go to the location where it has
11:48
been downloaded and in order to install
11:50
it we'll simply go ahead and double
11:52
click on the exe file and follow the
11:55
prompts here okay so accept the license
11:57
agreement accept and simply click on
12:00
next okay you'll see that it is
12:03
basically getting installed for a
12:05
particular user here right so setup will
12:07
install Visual Studio code in the
12:08
following folder so if you are not happy
12:10
with that I'll simply go ahead and
12:12
change this location I want it into the
12:16
C drive so I'll simply go back and I'll
12:19
say okay don't I'll say in the C drive
12:22
and let me create uh you'll see that in
12:25
in C says Microsoft vs code folder will
12:28
automatically get created okay so I've
12:30
just selected C drive so let me just
12:32
keep it at as a C drive and we can see
12:35
it will create this folder and all the
12:37
visual studio code will get installed
12:39
within this particular folder so I've
12:41
changed it I'll simply click on next and
12:43
you'll see that select start menu folder
12:45
this is the folder I'll keep it as
12:46
default and then I'll say next okay you
12:49
can create a desktop icon I don't want
12:52
it I'll simply leave it as is and then
12:54
you'll see that add to path right so
12:56
you'll see that it is by default check
12:58
so you I don't have to go to on Windows
13:01
PC or in the other platforms for example
13:05
if you simply during the installation
13:07
wizard itself you'll say add to path
13:09
then it will automatically add vs code
13:11
into the path so you don't have to add
13:12
it later okay I'll keep it default I'll
13:14
click on next and then simply click on
13:16
install so it is preparing to install
13:18
and will go ahead and install the vs
13:20
code on my computer okay so it is almost
13:23
done so you'll see that it is completing
13:25
the visual studio code setup is out you
13:27
can simply click on launch Visual Studio
13:29
code and then it will go ahead and
13:31
launch or if you don't want to launch
13:32
you just keep it unchecked and click on
13:35
finish okay so now we will see that vs
13:38
code has been installed if you go to the
13:39
start menu you'll see that Visual Studio
13:41
code and node.js are available on my
13:44
Windows machine which are recently okay
13:46
so this is basically the second the
13:49
third step right so we have installed
13:50
the preferred ID in this case for the
13:53
this particular tutorial we'll be using
13:55
visual studio code now these steps are
13:58
the step one okay now in the next video
14:00
we'll understand how you can go ahead
14:03
and install Cyprus and then we'll start
14:07
creating the first project and first
14:09
test case within site so that's all for
14:12
this particular video I hope it was
14:14
helpful thank you very much for watching
