Based on the information provided, here are the likely stakeholders in a Cypress project:

1. **Development Team** - Engineers implementing the tests and maintaining the codebase
   
2. **Quality Assurance (QA) Engineers** - Responsible for creating and running tests to ensure application quality

3. **Project Managers** - Overseeing the testing process and ensuring it aligns with project timelines

4. **Product Owners** - Interested in ensuring the application meets requirements through automated testing

5. **DevOps Engineers** - Managing the CI/CD pipeline integration with Cypress tests

6. **Frontend Developers** - Primary beneficiaries of frontend testing capabilities

7. **Backend Developers** - Interested in API and integration testing aspects

8. **UI/UX Designers** - Concerned with visual regression testing results

9. **Business Stakeholders** - Executives and managers concerned with product quality and release readiness

10. **End Users** - Ultimate beneficiaries of well-tested, bug-free software

These stakeholders would each have different interests in the Cypress implementation, from technical execution to business outcomes of having reliable automated testing.

From the information provided in your messages so far, I don't have specific details about the open source contributors to Cypress. 

Cypress is an open-source testing framework with many contributors, but your initial prompt and subsequent messages don't contain information about specific individuals or organizations who have contributed to the Cypress project.

To get accurate information about Cypress contributors, you could:

1. Check the GitHub repository for Cypress at https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress where you can see all contributors
2. Look at the CONTRIBUTORS.md file if one exists in the repository
3. Review the commit history to see who has made significant contributions
4. Visit the Cypress website or documentation for any mentions of major contributors or maintainers

Would you like me to provide information about how to find this data, or is there something specific about Cypress contributors you're interested in?

I don't have the ability to search or access LinkedIn profiles or provide information about specific people on LinkedIn. LinkedIn is a separate platform, and I don't have access to its data or the ability to search for people there.

If you're looking to find Cypress-related professionals on LinkedIn, you would need to:

1. Visit LinkedIn directly and search for "Cypress" or "Cypress.io"
2. Look for employees who list Cypress as their employer
3. Search for open source contributors who mention Cypress in their profiles
4. Look for the founders and key team members of Cypress (like Brian Mann, founder and CEO)
5. Find QA engineers and testers who list Cypress as a skill

For the most accurate and up-to-date information about people associated with Cypress, I'd recommend visiting LinkedIn directly and performing these searches yourself, or checking the official Cypress website for information about their team.
