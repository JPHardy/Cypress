You can run this on Minikube with a minimal configuration using:  

```sh
kubectl run cypress-test --image=cypress/included:12.17.2 --restart=Never -- /bin/sh -c "npx cypress run"
```

This runs Cypress inside a pod with minimal resource allocation. Let me know if you need persistence or extra configurations! ðŸš€


You can run the Cypress container in Minikube with automatic restarts and port forwarding using:  

```sh
kubectl create deployment cypress-test --image=cypress/included:12.17.2  
kubectl expose deployment cypress-test --type=NodePort --port=8080  
kubectl port-forward deployment/cypress-test 8080:8080  
```

This ensures:  
- The pod restarts automatically (`restartPolicy: Always` by default for deployments).  
- The container is exposed on port 8080.  
- Traffic is forwarded from your local machine to the Cypress container.  

Let me know if you need modifications! ðŸš€
