# Setting Up Cypress in a Container

Running Cypress in a container is a great approach for consistent test environments. Here's how to set it up with Docker:

## Basic Docker Implementation

1. Create a `Dockerfile`:
```
FROM cypress/included:latest

WORKDIR /app
COPY . .

# Install dependencies
RUN npm install

# Command to run Cypress tests
CMD ["cypress", "run"]
```

2. Build and run your container:
```
docker build -t cypress-tests .
docker run cypress-tests
```

## Using the Official Cypress Docker Image

Cypress provides official Docker images that come with Cypress pre-installed:

```
docker run -it -v $PWD:/app -w /app cypress/included:latest cypress run
```

This mounts your current directory into the container and runs your tests.

## Docker Compose Setup

For more complex setups, create a `docker-compose.yml`:
```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  cypress:
    image: cypress/included:latest
    volumes:
      - ./:/app
    working_dir: /app
    command: cypress run
```

Then run with:
```
docker-compose up
```
