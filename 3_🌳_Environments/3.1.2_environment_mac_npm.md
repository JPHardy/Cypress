# Installing Cypress on macOS

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js and npm**: Ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed, which includes npm (Node Package Manager). Verify their installation by running:

  ```bash
  node -v
  npm -v
  ```

  
If not installed, download and install them from the [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/).

## Step 1: Create a New Project Directory

1. Open the Terminal application.
2. Navigate to your desired parent directory and create a new folder for your project:

   ```bash
   mkdir my-cypress-project
   cd my-cypress-project
   ```

## Step 2: Initialize the Project

Initialize a new `package.json` file:

```bash
npm init -y
```


This command creates a `package.json` file with default settings.

## Step 3: Install Cypress

Install Cypress as a development dependency:

```bash
npm install cypress --save-dev
```


This will download and install Cypress locally in your project. citeturn0search0

## Step 4: Open Cypress

After installation, open the Cypress Test Runner:

```bash
npx cypress open
```


The first time you run this command, Cypress will create a default folder structure and example tests in your project directory.

## Step 5: Run Your First Test

In the Cypress Test Runner:

1. Locate the `examples` folder containing sample test files.
2. Click on any example test to run it and observe the test execution in the Cypress Test Runner.

You're now set up to write and run your own Cypress tests.
