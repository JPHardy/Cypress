[43474:0318/141755.470473:ERROR:atom_cache.cc(229)] Add _NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE_INDEX to kAtomsToCache  
```  

---

## üîç Observations  
- The error originates from **Cypress** during its initialization.  
- The specific error message `[ERROR:atom_cache.cc(229)] Add _NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE_INDEX to kAtomsToCache` suggests an issue with the **window manager** or **DevTools** integration in the Codespaces environment.  

---

## üí° Why This Happens  
Codespaces often run in a **headless or virtualized environment**, which may lack the necessary graphical components or configurations required by Cypress to open its GUI.  

---

## üöÄ Next Steps  
1. **Verify Dependencies**: Ensure all required dependencies for Cypress are installed in the Codespace.  
2. **Use Headless Mode**: If GUI is not required, consider running Cypress in headless mode using `npx cypress run`.  
3. **Check Logs**: Investigate additional logs for more details about the error.  
4. **Environment Configuration**: Modify the Codespace environment to support GUI applications if necessary.  

---

## üìù Notes  
- This error is specific to the **Codespaces environment** and may not occur on local machines with proper GUI support.  
- Refer to the [Cypress Documentation](https://docs.cypress.io/) for further troubleshooting steps.
