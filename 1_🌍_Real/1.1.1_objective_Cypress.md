# 🌟 Objective: Setting Up Cypress Environment in Codespaces  

Cypress is a powerful tool for end-to-end testing. In this guide, we'll set up a Cypress environment in GitHub Codespaces. 🚀  

## 🛠️ Prerequisites  
Before we begin, ensure you have the following:  
- A GitHub repository.  
- Access to GitHub Codespaces.  
- Basic knowledge of Node.js and npm.  

## 📦 Steps to Set Up Cypress  

### 1️⃣ Open Your Codespace  
1. Navigate to your GitHub repository.  
2. Click on the **Code** button and select **Codespaces**.  
3. Create or open an existing Codespace.  

### 2️⃣ Install Cypress  
1. Open the terminal in your Codespace.  
2. Initialize a Node.js project and install Cypress.  
3. Verify the installation by opening the Cypress Test Runner.  

### 3️⃣ Add Cypress to `package.json` Scripts  
- Add scripts to simplify running Cypress.  

### 4️⃣ Configure Cypress  
- Customize the default configurations in the `cypress.config.js` file if needed.  

### 5️⃣ Write Your First Test  
1. Create a new test file in the `cypress/e2e` folder.  
2. Write a sample test.  
3. Run the test using the appropriate script.  

## 🎯 Conclusion  
You’ve successfully set up Cypress in GitHub Codespaces! Now you can write and run end-to-end tests directly in your development environment. 🌈  

Happy Testing! 🧪
