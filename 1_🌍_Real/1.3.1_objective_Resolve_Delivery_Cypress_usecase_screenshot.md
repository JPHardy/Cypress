# 🌟 Objective: Use Cypress to Take Screenshots 📸

## 🚀 Overview
This document outlines the steps to use Cypress for capturing screenshots during your testing process. Screenshots can be incredibly helpful for debugging, visual validation, and documenting test results.

## 🛠️ Setting Up in Codespaces
1. **Open Your Codespace**: Ensure you are working within your GitHub Codespace environment for seamless integration and testing.
2. **Install Cypress**: Make sure Cypress is installed in your project. If not, add it to your dependencies.
3. **Configure Cypress**: Update your Cypress configuration file to enable screenshot functionality and customize paths if needed.

## 📋 Steps to Capture Screenshots
1. **Write Your Test**: Create or update a Cypress test file to include the necessary commands for taking screenshots.
2. **Use Screenshot Commands**: Leverage Cypress commands like `cy.screenshot()` to capture screenshots at specific points in your test.
3. **Run the Test**: Execute your test suite in the Codespace terminal to generate screenshots.
4. **Review Screenshots**: Navigate to the designated folder to review the captured images.

## 📂 Screenshot Storage
By default, Cypress saves screenshots in the `cypress/screenshots` directory. You can customize this location in the configuration file if needed.

## 🎯 Best Practices
- Use descriptive names for screenshots to make them easier to identify.
- Capture screenshots only when necessary to avoid clutter.
- Combine screenshots with video recordings for comprehensive test documentation.
